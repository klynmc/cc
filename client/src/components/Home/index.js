                    Does your pet suffer from separation 
                    anxiety? Always come home from
                    the kennel sick and stressed? Do you
                    worry if they are given the proper love and 
                    attention that they need?
                    Creature Comforts was designed to provide
                    a better sense of security to both pets 
                    and owners by allowing your pet to stay
                    in the comfort of their own home while you're away.
